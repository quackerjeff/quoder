# quoder

Seeded from Collaborative Multi-Agent Development as a `fullstack` repository.

## Workflow

Start your AI coding agent in this repository and ask it to read `AGENTS.md` first.

Example:

```text
Read AGENTS.md and SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md, then use prompts/scope.md to open the first spec for ...
```

## Local Setup

Before using this repository:

1. Replace placeholders in `AGENTS.md` and `SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`.
2. Add confirmed framework, SDK, and contract notes to `docs/tech.md`.
3. Create the first spec under `.cmd/specs/` for non-trivial work.
4. Make the guardrail scripts executable if you plan to run them locally:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/guardrails/*.sh
```
