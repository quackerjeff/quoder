# Spec-Driven Workflow

## When to Create a Spec

Create a spec before any non-trivial work — if it touches multiple files, involves architectural choices, or will be delegated to subagents.

## Directory Structure

```
.cmd/specs/currentspec.md  # Tracks current spec slug in use
.cmd/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
  spec.md        # Design decisions, requirements, constraints
  tasks.md       # Parallelized task list for execution
  review.md      # Reviewer findings per cycle
  security-review.md  # Security reviewer findings per cycle
  qa.md          # QA findings and release confidence per cycle
  decisions.md   # Mid-flight decision log
  prd/           # Product requirements documents (when work involves product roadmap decisions)
    <descriptive-title>.md

issues/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
  report.md      # Problem description, reproduction steps, impact, investigation
  summary.md     # Root cause, fix applied, prevention, status
```

Use a date-prefixed kebab-case slug for spec and issue folders. The date is the creation date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, followed by a short descriptive slug (e.g., `2026-03-04-auth-api`, `2026-02-27-vpc-redesign`). This ensures chronological ordering when listing directories.

## Current Spec Tracking (`currentspec.md`)

`currentspec.md` contains a single line: the slug of the active spec. This is the source of truth for which spec is in progress.

```markdown
2026-03-04-auth-api
```

**Rules:**
- **Write** when creating a new spec (Phase 1, step 2) — set to the new slug
- **Read** at the start of any workflow phase to resolve the active spec path (`specs/<slug>/`)
- **Clear** (delete the file) when the spec is complete (all groups pass review)
- Only one spec is active at a time. Starting a new spec overwrites the previous slug.

## Spec Format (`spec.md`)

```markdown
# <Title>

## Context
Why this work exists. Link to issues, conversations, or prior decisions.

## Decision
What we're doing and why. Include alternatives considered and why they were rejected.

## Constraints
- Budget, timeline, team, technical limitations
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance)

## Design
Technical approach — interfaces, data models, flows, diagrams as needed.

## Risks
Known unknowns and mitigation strategies.
```

## Task Format (`tasks.md`)

Tasks are organized into parallel groups. All tasks within a group can be executed simultaneously by independent subagents. Groups execute sequentially — group 2 starts only after group 1 is complete.

```markdown
# Tasks: <Title>

Spec: `specs/<slug>/spec.md`

## Group 1: <description>
- [ ] Task description | `path/to/relevant/files`
  - **Packages**: exact package names and versions (e.g., `strands-agents==0.1.x`, not `strands`)
  - **Accept**: measurable completion criteria
  - **Verify**: command(s) the subagent must run before marking complete
  - **Constraints**: explicit "do not" rules or known gotchas

## Group 2: <description>
- [ ] Task description | `path/to/relevant/files`
  - **Accept**: measurable completion criteria
  - **Verify**: command(s) the subagent must run before marking complete
```

### Task Rules

- Each task MUST be self-contained — a subagent should be able to complete it with no knowledge of sibling tasks in the same group
- Each task specifies relevant file paths and clear acceptance criteria
- Every task MUST include an **Accept** field with measurable criteria and a **Verify** field with at least one command to run
- Include **Packages** with exact PyPI/npm names and version constraints when the task involves dependencies
- Include **Constraints** to call out known naming gotchas, common mistakes, or explicit "do not" rules
- Subagents mark tasks `[x]` when complete — only after verification passes
- If a task is blocked or fails, mark it `[!]` and add a note below it
- Keep tasks small enough that one subagent can finish in a single session

### Group Ordering

The default task group ordering is:

1. Research group (mandatory Group 1)
2. UI design group when user-facing behavior needs design definition
3. Implementation groups (one or more)
4. **Review gate** — all implementation groups must pass review before proceeding
5. **QA gate** — validate behavior and regression risk before documenting completion
6. Documentation group (mandatory final group)

**Deploys are out-of-band by default.** Most projects deploy via a CI/CD pipeline that runs after the spec is merged — the pipeline is not part of the spec's task list, and the spec finishes at the documentation group.

**In-spec deploy groups are the exception, not the rule.** Only include a deploy group when the spec itself must perform a deploy to be considered done — e.g., bootstrapping new infrastructure before a pipeline exists, or one-off migrations that don't fit the pipeline. A deploy group is any group whose tasks include `deploy.sh`, `cdk deploy`, infrastructure provisioning, or production-affecting operations.

When a spec does include an in-spec deploy group, the ordering is:

1. Research group
2. UI design group when needed
3. Implementation groups
4. **Review gate** — must issue PASS before deploy runs
5. Deploy/verification group
6. **QA gate** — validate post-implementation or post-deploy behavior as appropriate
7. Documentation group (still the final group)

Documentation is always the final group regardless of whether a deploy group is present.

Frontend-heavy specs should usually include an explicit UI design task or group before implementation. See `steering/frontend-design.md`.

### Verification Requirements by Technology

**Verify** commands must actually validate the output, not just check that files parse or import:

| Technology | Weak (don't use) | Strong (use this) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CDK | `python3 -c "from stack import MyStack"` | `cdk synth StackName 2>&1` |
| CloudFormation | `cat template.yaml` | `aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://template.yaml` |
| Terraform | `terraform fmt` | `terraform validate` |
| Docker | `cat Dockerfile` | `docker build --check .` |
| Python | `python3 -c "import module"` | `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` |
| TypeScript | `cat src/index.ts` | `npx tsc --noEmit` |

Import checks only prove a file parses — they do NOT validate that constructs, resources, or configurations are correct. Always use the tool's own validation command.

### Dependency Research

Every spec that introduces or relies on SDK/framework APIs MUST include a research step before implementation tasks.

**Group 1 must include a documentation research task** that:
1. Looks up current API docs for each key dependency (AWS docs, Context7, official docs)
2. Verifies constructor signatures, handler conventions, and import paths
3. Writes findings to the project's `docs/tech.md`
4. Implementation tasks in later groups reference `docs/tech.md` — not assumed APIs

**Mandatory Group 1 task template:**

```markdown
- [ ] Research and document SDK/framework APIs | `docs/tech.md`
  - **Accept**: `docs/tech.md` contains verified import paths, constructor signatures, and usage patterns for all key dependencies in this spec
  - **Verify**: Each documented pattern has a source citation (doc URL or `inspect.signature()` output)
  - **Constraints**: Implementation tasks MUST reference `docs/tech.md` — do not write code against unverified APIs
```

**Additional requirements for alpha/preview packages:**
- Pin exact versions in the spec (no ranges)
- Run `inspect.signature()` or equivalent to verify actual API surface
- Flag in spec Constraints section which deps are alpha vs stable

### Mandatory Review Gate

Every spec MUST include a review gate after all implementation groups complete. The orchestrator delegates to the `reviewer` subagent to inspect all implementation work.

- **Default (no in-spec deploy group):** the review gate is the second-to-last group, immediately before documentation.
- **Spec includes an in-spec deploy group (rare — see Group Ordering):** the review gate runs before deploy (research → implementation → review gate → deploy → documentation).

**Mandatory review gate task template:**

```markdown
## Group N: Review gate
- [ ] Code review of all implementation groups | `.cmd/specs/<slug>/review.md`
  - **Accept**: Reviewer returned a verdict of PASS, and the orchestrator persisted the returned review report verbatim to `review.md`. Zero critical findings, zero warnings.
  - **Verify**: `grep -i 'verdict.*pass' .cmd/specs/<slug>/review.md`
  - **Constraints**: Do NOT proceed to the next group until this passes. Maximum 3 review cycles — escalate to user if still failing.
```

### Mandatory Final Group: Documentation Update

The last group in every `tasks.md` MUST include a documentation update task. Documentation written against finished, reviewed code is accurate documentation. Delegate this task to the `docs` subagent.

**Mandatory final group task template:**

```markdown
## Group N: Documentation update
- [ ] Update documentation for spec changes | `README.md`, `docs/`
  - **Accept**: README and relevant docs reflect all changes made in this spec — no stale references, no missing features
  - **Verify**: `grep -r 'TODO\|FIXME\|PLACEHOLDER' README.md docs/ || true` returns no spec-related placeholders
  - **Constraints**: Do not document features that were descoped or marked `[!]` in earlier groups
```

What to update (check each):
- **README.md** — if user-facing behavior, CLI commands, config, dependencies, or folder structure changed
- **Architecture docs** — if services, data flows, or integration patterns changed
- **Inline docstrings** — if public function/class signatures changed
- **Runbooks** — if operational procedures or deployment steps changed

### QA Gate

Most non-trivial specs should include a QA task after implementation and review. The QA role validates behavior, regression risk, and release confidence separately from code review.

**Typical QA gate task template:**

```markdown
## Group N: QA gate
- [ ] Validate implemented behavior and regression coverage | `.cmd/specs/<slug>/qa.md`
  - **Accept**: QA report documents what was validated, major scenarios covered, residual gaps, release confidence, and a PASS/FAIL verdict
  - **Verify**: `grep -i 'verdict.*pass\\|verdict.*fail' .cmd/specs/<slug>/qa.md`
  - **Constraints**: Do NOT mark complete if critical acceptance criteria remain unvalidated
```

### Parallelization Guidelines

When structuring groups, maximize parallelism:
- **Test skeletons go in early groups** — define expected behavior before implementation
- Implementation tasks reference the tests they must make pass
- Tasks with no shared file writes go in the same group
- Tasks that produce outputs consumed by later tasks go in earlier groups
- Infrastructure before application code
- Shared libraries/interfaces before consumers
- Tests can often parallel with implementation if interfaces are defined first

## Review Format (`review.md`)

The reviewer returns findings as read-only review output. The orchestrator persists
that returned report verbatim to `review.md`.

The orchestrator must not summarize, reinterpret, alter findings, or change the
reviewer's verdict when persisting the report.

Each review cycle gets its own section.

```markdown
# Review: <Title>

## Cycle 1 — <date>
Reviewing: Group 1 tasks

### Critical
- [file:line] Description of issue and recommended fix

### Warning
- [file:line] Description of issue and recommended fix

### Suggestion
- [file:line] Description of improvement

### Tests
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage adequate for changes

### Verdict: PASS | FAIL
```

Verdict is **FAIL** if any Critical or Warning findings exist, or tests are not passing. Otherwise **PASS**.

## Security Review Format (`security-review.md`)

The security reviewer returns findings as read-only review output. The orchestrator
persists that returned report verbatim to `security-review.md`.

The orchestrator must not summarize, reinterpret, alter findings, or change the
security reviewer's verdict when persisting the report.

The security review happens after the general review passes. Each cycle gets its
own section.

```markdown
# Security Review: <Title>

## Cycle 1 — <date>
Reviewing: Groups 1-N

### Critical
- [file:line] Description of vulnerability and remediation

### Warning
- [file:line] Description of risk and recommended mitigation

### Suggestion
- [file:line] Description of hardening opportunity

### Verdict: PASS | FAIL
```

Verdict is **FAIL** if any Critical or Warning security findings exist. Otherwise **PASS**.

## QA Report Format (`qa.md`)

The QA engineer writes findings here. Each validation cycle gets its own section.

```markdown
# QA Report: <Title>

## Cycle 1 — <date>
Validating: Groups 1-N

### Coverage
- Automated:
- Manual:
- Not covered:

### Critical
- [area] Description of failure and user impact

### Warning
- [area] Description of issue and risk

### Suggestion
- [area] Description of hardening or extra coverage

### Release Confidence
- READY | CONDITIONAL | NOT READY

### Verdict: PASS | FAIL
```

## Decisions Log (`decisions.md`)

Records decisions made during implementation that aren't significant enough for the spec but need to be tracked. Prevents the same question from being re-asked across cycles.

```markdown
# Decisions: <Title>

## <date> — <short description>
**Context**: What prompted the decision
**Decision**: What was decided
**Rationale**: Why
```

## Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`)

Create a PRD when the work involves a product roadmap decision — new features, feature changes, deprecations, or anything that affects what the product does for users. Not needed for purely technical/infrastructure work with no user-facing impact.

- **Location**: `prd/<descriptive-title>.md` within the spec folder
- **File naming**: Use a descriptive kebab-case title (e.g., `prd/user-auth-sso-support.md`)

```markdown
# PRD: <Title>

## Problem Statement
What user problem or opportunity this addresses.

## Goals
- Measurable outcomes this work should achieve

## Non-Goals
- What this work explicitly does NOT cover

## User Stories
- As a [persona], I want [action] so that [outcome]

## Requirements
### Must Have
- [requirement]

### Should Have
- [requirement]

### Won't Have (this iteration)
- [requirement]

## Success Metrics
How we measure whether this achieved its goals.

## Open Questions
Unresolved product decisions that need stakeholder input.
```

## Issues (`issues/`)

Issues track bugs, problems, and investigations. They live at the project root in `issues/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`.

### Issue Report (`report.md`)

```markdown
# Issue: <Title>

## Summary
One-line description of the problem.

## Impact
Who/what is affected and severity.

## Reproduction
Steps to reproduce, environment details, relevant logs.

## Investigation
What was checked, what was ruled out, root cause analysis.
```

### Issue Summary (`summary.md`)

Written after the issue is resolved.

```markdown
# Resolution: <Title>

## Root Cause
What caused the issue.

## Fix Applied
What was changed and where.

## Prevention
What prevents recurrence (tests, monitoring, guardrails).

## Status
RESOLVED | MITIGATED | WONT_FIX
```

## Development Loop

### Phase 1: Plan
1. **Research** — gather context, explore codebase, check docs
2. **SDK/Framework research** — for each dependency, look up current API docs using AWS documentation search and Context7. Write verified patterns, import paths, and constructor signatures to the project's `docs/tech.md`
3. **Spec** — write `spec.md` with decisions and design (reference `docs/tech.md` for API contracts), then write the slug to `.cmd/specs/currentspec.md`
4. **Plan** — create `tasks.md` with parallelized groups

### Phase 2: Build (per group)
1. **Read `.cmd/specs/currentspec.md`** to resolve the active spec slug and path
2. **Delegate to subagents when available** — launch group tasks to `coder` and/or `ops` in parallel. Each subagent should receive the active spec path and exact task scope.
3. **Verify completion** — confirm all tasks in the group are `[x]`
4. **Run tests** — execute the test suite, confirm all tests pass
5. **Review (mandatory gate)** — delegate to the repository-read-only `reviewer`. The reviewer returns its review report as output. The orchestrator persists that report verbatim to `review.md`. Do NOT proceed to the next group until the review verdict is PASS. This step is not optional — skipping review is a workflow violation.
6. **Security review (mandatory gate)** — after the general review passes, delegate to the repository-read-only `security-reviewer`. The security reviewer returns its review report as output. The orchestrator persists that report verbatim to `security-review.md`. Do NOT proceed until both reviews pass.
7. **QA validation (conditional gate)** — determine whether dedicated QA is required using `steering/quality-engineering.md`. When required, delegate to `qa-engineer` and persist findings to `qa.md`; QA must pass before the spec is complete. When a separate QA task is not required, record that decision explicitly in the spec.

> ⚠️ **ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT PARALLELIZE REVIEW GATES**
>
> Review (step 5), security review (step 6), and documentation are SEQUENTIAL gates, not parallel tasks. When QA is required, it must also complete before documentation.
> The required review order is: review → wait for PASS → security review → wait for PASS. Required QA then runs according to `steering/quality-engineering.md`.
> NEVER launch review, security-review, and documentation subagents simultaneously.
> This is the most common workflow violation. Speed does not justify skipping gates.

### Phase 3: Fix (if needed)
1. **Read `.cmd/specs/currentspec.md`** to resolve the active spec
2. **Evaluate reviews** — read `review.md` and `security-review.md` for the current cycle
3. **If FAIL** — create fix tasks as a new group in `tasks.md` (e.g., `## Fix Group 1: Address review cycle 1`), then go to step 1 of Phase 2
4. **If PASS** — proceed to next group (back to Phase 2 step 1) or finish
5. **On completion** (all groups pass) — delete `.cmd/specs/currentspec.md`

### Completion Criteria

The loop stops when ALL of the following are true:
- **Zero critical findings** in the latest review cycle
- **Zero warnings** in the latest review cycle
- **Zero critical findings** in the latest security review cycle
- **Zero warnings** in the latest security review cycle
- **All tests passing**
- **All tasks marked `[x]`**

Suggestions do NOT block completion — log them for future improvement.

### Loop Safeguards
- Maximum 3 review cycles per group. If still failing after 3, escalate to the user with a summary of unresolved criticals.
- Log each decision made during fixes in `decisions.md` to prevent re-litigation.
